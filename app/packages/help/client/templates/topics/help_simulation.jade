    p.inline
      | In this mode, users can select at least one origination airport (node),
      | a date range, and a maximum number of passengers to consider.
      | FLIRT displays the results of a
      a(href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method') Monte Carlo
      | simulation, outputting likely passenger destinations from a
      | specified origin based on previous analysis of common passenger
      | layover and transfer probabilities.

      p The simulations mirror real life traveler behavior to give analyst an accurate picture of travel patterns. Flight legs are combined into a single path and visualized on the map. A heatmap layer and rank-ordered list of flights based on the total number of passengers to terminal destinations are generated during the simulation. Details of each simulation are are stored in FLIRTâ€™s backend to facilitate easy repetition and sharing.
