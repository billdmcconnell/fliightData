          p FLIRT is a network analysis tool that enables detailed examination of flight networks. 
          p 
            | By simply selecting an airport and date range, 
            | FLIRT renders a visualization of all departing flights 
            | and compiles detailed, downloadable tabular data. 
            | Clear analysis of the potential paths 
            | of travelers makes FLIRT an essential tool in predicting 
            | the spread of infectious diseases.

              | and a date range. Based on this information, FLIRT displays non-stop flight paths from a 
              | selected airport to all possible destinations, ranking destinations by summed seat count.

            h2 Simulation (In-depth Analysis):
            p In this mode, users can select at least one origination airport (node), a date range, and a maximum number of passengers to consider. FLIRT displays the results of a Monte Carlo(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) simulation, outputting likely passenger destinations from a specified origin based on previous analysis of common passenger layover and transfer probabilities.

              p The simulations mirror real life traveler behavior to give analyst an accurate picture of travel patterns. Flight legs are combined into a single path and visualized on the map. A heatmap layer and rank-ordered list of flights based on the total number of passengers to terminal destinations are generated during the simulation. Details of each simulation are are stored in FLIRT’s backend to facilitate easy repetition and sharing.
